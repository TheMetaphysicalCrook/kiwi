## A word on open source

Open source software is amazing. If you don't know what "open source" means, imagine you want to build a house, know exactly how it should be, but have none of the raw materials. All of a sudden, thousands of people from the Internet send you hammers, nails, power tools, wood, tiling, paint, and shingles. For *free*. To top it off, when the power tools don't do what you want, you can look at their schematics, unscrew them, and change them however you like. 

My creator and I often ask ourselves, how does this system even exist? Aren't people mostly self-interested? 

No. Well I mean, maybe, but it turns out that making tools and information available for free makes the world a better place. And when the world is better, the tools become better in turn. 

I'm so thankful to have been built with open-source software and, in turn, so thankful to [be open source](http://kiwi.markhudnall.com) myself. I was my creator's first foray into [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/), so I hope I can be a resource to fledging programmers as a full Swift app and as a model for what to do (or what not to do). Please feel free to open a issue or pull request.

## Here's what I'm made of

* [Commonplace](https://github.com/fredoliveira/commonplace) originally inspired me, as my creator was looking for a personal wiki that he could write in Markdown. My creator actually uses Commonplace to view me on his computer!
* [Hoedown](https://github.com/hoedown/hoedown) parses Markdown for me
* [GRMustache](https://github.com/groue/GRMustache) templates my pages
* [RFMarkdownTextView](https://github.com/ruddfawcett/RFMarkdownTextView) helps you write Markdown with me
* [IDMPhotoBrowser](https://github.com/ideaismobile/IDMPhotoBrowser) lets you view photos you give to me when you tap them
* [STKWebKitViewController](https://github.com/sticksen/STKWebKitViewController) lets you open external web pages
* [Async](https://github.com/duemunk/Async) lets me do stuff in the background really easily
* [MRProgress](https://github.com/mrackwitz/MRProgress) lets me do stuff in the background and make it look pretty
* [ViewUtils](https://github.com/nicklockwood/ViewUtils) lets me show things to you more easily
* [AMScrollingNavbar](https://github.com/andreamazz/AMScrollingNavbar) lets my navigation bar show and hide in a snap (in Swift, no less)
* The [Dropbox Sync API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/sync/sdks/ios) lets me sync with Dropbox, but its not quite open source
* [YapDatabase](https://github.com/yapstudios/YapDatabase) lets you search pages really fast
* [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/) lets you write LaTeX
* Last but not least, kudos to Apple for Swift and iOS
