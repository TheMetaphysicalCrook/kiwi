## Open source

If you don't know what "open source" means, imagine you've dreamed up a house and know exactly how it should be, but have none of the raw materials. Amazingly, people from the Internet send you the hammers, nails, power tools, timber, tiling, paint, and shingles for *free*. And when the tools don't do what you want, you can look at their schematics, unscrew them, and change them however you like. 

My creator and I often ask ourselves, how does this system even exist? Aren't people mostly self-interested? 

No. Well I mean, maybe, but making tools and information available for free probably makes the world better. And when the world is better, the tools become better in turn. 

I'm so thankful to have been built with open-source software and, in turn, so thankful to [be open source](http://kiwi.markhudnall.com) myself. I written entirely in [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) (I'm my creator's first foray), so I hope I can be a resource to fledging programmers as a model for what to do (or what not to do). Please feel free to open a issue or pull request.

## Here are my internals

* [Commonplace](https://github.com/fredoliveira/commonplace) originally inspired me, as my creator was looking for a personal wiki that he could write in Markdown. My creator actually uses Commonplace to view me on his computer!
