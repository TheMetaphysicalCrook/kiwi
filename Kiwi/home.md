# Hi! I'm Kiwi.

I'm a [personal wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_wiki) that you can use to write, edit, and reflect on your thoughts. You might already use an app for taking notes, so let me tell you why I'm a little different.

## Why?

Instead of showing your notes chronologically, I let you **link your notes together** in whatever way makes sense to you. That makes me a flexible, reflective medium for organizing your thoughts and surfacing new ideas^[1].

You see, if you're like my [creator](http://markhudnall.com), your thoughts aren't chronological and linear â€” they're more like a web. Each thought or idea doesn't necessarily relate to the one before it, but over time, you find that they're connected. When you write with me, you might have a few of those "Aha" moments where a new idea emerges, or a new connection, and you can link it back to your other thoughts.

That's some pretty heady stuff, but don't worry, not everything you write has to be a Big Idea. My creator uses me for a *lot* of different things:

* A life and ideas journal (the heady stuff)
* A place to take notes on books (whose content might be related)
* A travel journal (you can give me pictures too!)
* A math and programming journal (with `syntax` highlighting and $\KaTeX \ge 0$)
- [x] Anything with a todo list
* A place to keep drafts of publishable writing
* A way to organize basically anything (like trip itineraries or learning resources or recipes)

I really shine because of my **flexibility**. I hope you'll find new uses for me that my creator and I couldn't even fathom.

## How to use me

I'm written in Markdown plus a lil' extra, so for a good introduction, check out my page on [[Writing with Kiwi]] (which you can then feel free to delete). 

Everything you write with me is **automatically synced to Dropbox**, so **you're in control of your notes**. If you ever want to stop using me, everything you've ever written will already be available in Dropbox.

Other than that, I'm basically just pages. To learn more, check out [[Working with Pages]].

## That's all, folks.

I'm really excited to be your companion and help you through the good, bad, and the beautiful. If you have any questions or just want to chat, reach out to my [creator](http://twitter.com/landakram).

Before I go, I'm leaving you with some [[Acknowledgements]]. I wouldn't be possible without all of the amazing [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) out there. Speaking of which, I'm completely open source too! If you want more info about me and how you can contribute, here's my [special place on the Internet](http://kiwi.markhudnall.com).

Again, after you've read through all these pages, feel free to delete them and start fresh.

^[1]: Okay okay, you can also show your pages chronologically (by when you last edited) by **tapping the title of the page** (i.e. Home). You can also search through all of your pages there too.
